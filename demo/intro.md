# About  

+++ {"part":"abstract"}

% The article should include an abstract block at the beginning. The block is delimited by `+++` before and after, and you must specify `"part": "abstract"` as JSON metadata on the block opener. This metadata is required for recognizing the content of this cell as the abstract.
% The abstract should begin with a short description of the problem addressed, briefly describe the new data or analyses, then briefly state the main conclusion(s) and how they are supported, and address any uncertainty.

This demo is created in collaboration with European Pangeo community and EGI.

This demo will provide a comprehensive overview of Pangeo@EOSC to help you understand how this EOSC service can be used for Earth science data analysis and interpretation.
